##  Abstract

These files are just a collection of files that I can use for projects. It started as a thought experiment. 

### Why?

You're probably wondering why on earth I created something like this. That is a completely valid question. I love that
PHP provides the fluidity of a duck type language, but thanks to frameworks such as Symfony pushing for more strongly 
typed structures, with all the benefits of dynamically typed. Think of it as "Duck-Typed With Benefits."

I wanted to give myself the flexibility and write objects for `String`, `Array`, `HashTable`, and `Dictionary`. I am 
fully aware that this isn't really needed, and should be handled by the core language if it were. I wanted to try and I 
have enjoyed using them in my personal projects.
